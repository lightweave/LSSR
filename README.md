# The Landscape of Space Science Research (LSSR)
This project started to make a systematic review of developments in space science. We all know that academic reading is hard. Now we have billions of articles issued every year in our beloved journals. Many of them are open source and ready to reach our consideration. From time to time every researcher try to improve their reading experience using special techniques. Such techniques include mind maps and similar graph-like systematizing  plots or either paintings [CrystalRenfro 2017](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acalib.2017.02.004) . But of course terms included in mind map cover only one theme. How can we make a unbiased review of current state of whole field of knowledge?

## Materials and methods

Primary method of analysis is Gource, applied to a database of space science articles. For appropriate

All text was downloaded and using fulltext package, part of ropensci project.

### Library preparing

First we scan all articles for common terms. All high - frequency terms added to the dictionary. Every expert collect terms related to separate section of space research. Second the experts analyze dictionary for synonyms and clear his part of dictionary. It is the most time consuming procedure.
